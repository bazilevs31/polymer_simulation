# this program calculates alignment for each individual chain




def calc_align_vec():
	"""calculates average alignment vector
	"""

def calc_g2():
	"""takes chain bonds coordinates as an input
	uses calc_align_vec to calculate average alignment vector
	outputs cos2a of average chain alignment
	"""
