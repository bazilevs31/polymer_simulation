Create and equilibrate melt in MD.

To make it work:

1) install Lammps MD package
2) brush through files and find a mpirun command and change it to appropriate
3) also code uses a moltemplate package to add angles and dihedrals

please install moltemplate and add it to the path

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/mylammps/tools/moltemplate/src"

type 'bash create_melt.sh'
or just './create_melt.sh'



What scripts do in a nutshell:

1) create a polymer melt, consisting of atoms 
(parameters should be specified in the create_melt.sh file)

2) then the melt is equilibrated by means of Lammps MD package. Using alghorithms proposed by : 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261411015508

( the result file is a lammps .data file, which has only atoms + bonds )

3) then the .data file is transformed into a regular lammps file which includes angles and dihedrals as well
this is done by lj_without_to_real_with.sh
also units are switched from lj to real

4) then a short nve lammps is performed 
the result should be a well equilibrated melt,
with matching RDF file,
